# Gist
This contains my zsh config with Powerlevel10k (.zshrc and .p10k.zsh)

## Install
Simply run `./install.sh`, which will remove any existing zsh config, clone the Powerlevel10k repo/config, overwriting the default settings (which is to run the p10k setup) with my own.  
`install.sh` also automatically runs `font_install.sh` to setup the recommended fonts for the current user __(do not run this script as sudo)__. The terminal emulator app used must manually be set up to use this font. Its name is `MesloLGS NF`.
